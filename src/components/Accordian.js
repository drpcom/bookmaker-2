                   <p className='line-clamp-5 text-xs flex flex-row text-left lg:line-clamp-7 dark:text-slate-200'>Recently, there has been a renewed interest in emo, especially midwest emo. These bands are heavily influenced by Cap'n Jazz and often have a strong bent towards math rock and post-rock in their song structure and guitar work. A few examples of these twinkledaddy bands are Street Smart Cyclist, Snowing, Algernon Cadwallader, The World Is A Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die, and Glocca Morra. As this scene grew and grew in popularity, #emorevival became a near-mainstream style of indie rock which took from various facets of Midwest, screamo, and emo pop, as played by bands such as the Hotelier, Free Throw, and late-period You Blew It!</p>
